## Features

- **Real-time Floor Map**: Visual grid showing which slots are `Available` (Green) or `Occupied` (Red).
- **Concurrent Booking**: Thread-safe locking mechanism using Python's `threading.Lock` to prevent double-booking.
- **Easy Release**: Relinquish slots instantly using a generated 8-character unique Booking ID.
- **Admin Control**: Dedicated tab for administrators to monitor live records and perform a full system reset.
- **Reactive UI**: Statuses update immediately across the app without manual page refreshes using `st.rerun()`.
- **Secure Database**: Persistent storage using SQLite with input validation to protect against SQL injection.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (for the interactive web interface)
- **Backend**: Python 3 (Threading for concurrency control)
- **Database**: SQLite3 (Lightweight, serverless relational database)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for a clean UI (removes default dropdown arrows).
